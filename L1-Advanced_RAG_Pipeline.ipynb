      "Imposter syndrome is when individuals doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite evidence of their success. In the context of AI, newcomers to the field may experience imposter syndrome, feeling like they do not truly belong in the AI community even if they have achieved success. This feeling can be common among individuals in AI, including accomplished professionals, due to the technical complexity of the field. However, it is emphasized that experiencing challenges and setbacks is a normal part of the learning process in AI, and it should not deter anyone from pursuing a career in the field.\n",
